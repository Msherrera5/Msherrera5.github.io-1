                    <p class="rtext">The first three Uncharted games, developed by Naughty Dog, play amazingly in their remastered versions on Playstation 4, done by Bluepoint Studios. Playing as Nathan Drake in the three single-player adventures, you travel around the world chasing legendary treasures and killing bad guys. The three games in the collection all came out on the Playstation 3, the first one in 2007, its sequel in 2009, and a third but not final game in 2011. The concluding story to Nathan Drake is called ‘Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End’ and released for the Playstation 4 in 2016</p>
                    <p class="rtext">Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune was a reason to buy a Playstation 3 over the competing consoles at the time, those being the Xbox 360 by Microsoft and the Wii by Nintendo. In the first game, Nathan Drake and his friend sully go to Borneo, looking for El Dorado when a rich villain shows up and tries to take the treasure for himself. The 3rd-Person shooting combat was fun in the first one, forcing the player to approach every situation with a plan and to not just barge in and start shooting, even though that works sometimes. I do heavily recommend everyone who can do it to play the first game, especially those who want to feel like an action hero.</p>
                    <p class="rtext">Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is claimed to be the best game in the series. I can not disagree with this, Uncharted 2’s story vastly improves on the first games, as well as its combat. There are new characters, new locations, but still a rich villain who sends hundreds of men to kill you. In this game you look for the lost city of Shambala, a mythical kingdom in the Buddhist religion. In the first game, Nathan Drake doesn’t do anything crazy, but Among Thieves starts the player off by having them HANG OFF OF A TRAIN FALLING OVER A CLIFF. There are many more moments like this in Uncharted 2: Among Theives, which is certainly a must-play in my book.</p>
                    <p class="rtext">The final game in the Nathan Drake collection is Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception. This game had the most beautiful environments of the three, having the player explore abandoned buildings in France to walking in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula. Like Among Thieves did to the first game, Drake’s Deception takes everything that the second game did and improves on it. There are more weapons, the environments are more colorful and memorable, and the story is better. You get a chance to visit Nathan Drake’s past via flashbacks throughout the game. If you had to play only one Uncharted game, I would recommend this one.</p>
                    <p class="rtext">Luckily, you don’t have to decide on one of the fantastic games because they are all available in one collection for Playstation 4. The Nathan Drake Collection is about 15-20 dollars and is worth every penny. Uncharted is a series that you don’t want to miss out on.</p>
